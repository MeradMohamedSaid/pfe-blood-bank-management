Life Flow is a web application designed to provide an innovative and efficient solution for blood management by streamlining and digitizing the entire process, from donor registration to blood distribution.

## Problematic

Traditional paper-based blood management systems are fraught with inefficiencies and errors. These systems often suffer from:

- **Inaccurate and Delayed Data**: Manual data entry and retrieval can lead to outdated or incorrect information, making it challenging to match donors with recipients quickly and accurately.
- **High Administrative Overhead**: Managing paper records is time-consuming and labor-intensive, diverting resources away from essential medical services.
- **Increased Error Rates**: Human error in manual processes can result in critical mistakes, such as mismatching blood types or losing important donor information.
- **Limited Accessibility**: Paper records are not easily accessible to multiple users simultaneously, hindering the coordination and responsiveness of blood bank operations.
